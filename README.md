# Calorie Counter

A simple Java application to calculate calorie requirements based on user input.

## Description

This project provides a basic command-line Java program that allows users to input personal metrics such as age, weight, height, and activity level, and receive a recommended daily calorie requirement. It’s designed as an educational tool for understanding user input, calculations, and Java program structure.

## Features

* Accepts user inputs for age, gender, weight, height, and activity level.
* Computes and displays estimated daily calorie needs.
* Modular code structure with separate classes:

  * `CalorieCalculator.java` — contains the core calculation logic.
  * `MainApp.java` — handles user interaction and input.
  * `ResultDisplay.java` — formats and displays the results.
* Written entirely in Java with no external dependencies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
* Command-line terminal or any Java IDE

### Installation and Running

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Divyanshh31/calorie_counter.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd calorie_counter
   ```
3. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java MainApp
   ```

## Usage

* Enter your age, gender, weight, height, and activity level when prompted.
* The program will calculate and display your daily calorie requirement.
* You can use this estimate to understand your energy needs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. You can improve this project by:

* Adding a graphical user interface (GUI)
* Supporting both metric and imperial units
* Allowing data saving and loading
* Extending the calorie breakdown to include macronutrients

Would you like me to make it shorter (for example, under 15 lines) for a minimal README?
